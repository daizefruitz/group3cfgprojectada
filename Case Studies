       <div class="introduction"><center><h3>Women in tech refers to the participation, representation, and impact of women in the technology industry. Despite an increase in women pursuing tech careers, there remains a significant gender gap. Women continue to face unequal opportunities and obstacles, including gender bias, stereotypes, and discrimination. However, women's contribution to the technology industry cannot be ignored, as they bring diversity, innovation, and creativity to the table.These women have broken barriers and challenged the gender stereotypes that have traditionally limited women's involvement in the tech industry. From Ada Lovelace, who wrote the first-ever computer program in the mid-1800s, to modern-day trailblazers like Sheryl Sandberg, women continue to make outstanding contributions to the field.These women serve as a reminder that women can and do play a vital role in the world of technology. It is crucial to create a more inclusive and diverse tech industry that welcomes and supports women in tech.</h3></center></div></p>
